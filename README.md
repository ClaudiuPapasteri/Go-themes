Go themes and skins


### WuWeiBrew
Inspired by [Coffee Moyo](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1649988) theme by Sica 璞木 Go Skins. 

Uses edited [*yunzi2*](https://github.com/billhails/SabakiThemes/blob/main/yunzi2) stones and [*BattsGo*](https://github.com/JJscott/BattsGo) board from the corresponding Sabaki themese.

Ergo, this is hardly my work on top of other fully open projects. Use it as you will.

### OGS-simple-bg
Sets a custom background on OGS game/review/demo pages.

This is barebones version of a Tampermonkey script by SoumyaK4 (https://soumyak4.in): https://github.com/SoumyaK4/OGS-Tampermonkey

Just edit the `DEFAULT_BG` with your own picture. I use DEFAULT_BG = 'https://claudiupapasteri.github.io/Go-themes/OGS-simple-bg/Immortals_Playing_Weiqi_on_Penglai_(overley).jpg'. 

This is a 16th century ink and color on silk piece of Daoist art entitled _**Immortals Playing Weiqi on Penglai**_ that helps me keep the Wuu Weing when I blunder and lose _won_ games (should have even a more profound effect if you [see it at the Smithsonian](https://asia.si.edu/explore-art-culture/collections/search/edanmdm:fsg_F1911.188/)).

New feature: Now the script runs by default the [OGS move-timing script](https://github.com/psalaets/ogs-move-timing) when on appropiate pages.

If the script doesn't run with message "This script was not executed yet", enable "Developer Mode" in the Manage Extensions area of the browser.

How to use:
1. Install Tampermonkey browser extension
2. Click here on [OGS-simple-bg.user.js](https://github.com/ClaudiuPapasteri/Go-themes/raw/refs/heads/main/OGS-simple-bg/OGS-simple-bg.user.js), triggering a Tampermonkey pop-up asking if you want to install the script.
<!-- 2. Click the Raw button of the `OGS-simple-bg.user.js` or access the raw URL, triggering a Tampermonkey pop-up asking if you want to install the script. -->
4. Edit the script with your parameters and install it.
