Go themes and skins


### WuWeiBrew
Inspired by [Coffee Moyo](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1649988) theme by Sica 璞木 Go Skins. 

Uses edited [*yunzi2*](https://github.com/billhails/SabakiThemes/blob/main/yunzi2) stones and [*BattsGo*](https://github.com/JJscott/BattsGo) board from the corresponding Sabaki themese.

Ergo, this is hardly my work on top of other fully open projects. Use it as you will.

### OGS-simple-bg
Sets a custom background on OGS game/review/demo pages.

This is barebones version of a Tampermonkey script by SoumyaK4 (https://soumyak4.in): https://github.com/SoumyaK4/OGS-Tampermonkey

Just edit the `DEFAULT_BG` with your own picture.

I use DEFAULT_BG = 'https://claudiupapasteri.github.io/Go-themes/OGS-simple-bg/Immortals_Playing_Weiqi_on_Penglai_(overley).jpg'. It is a 16th century ink and color on silk pice of Daoist art entitled _**Immortals Playing Weiqi on Penglai**_ that helps me keep the Wuu Weing when blunder and lose _won_ games (should have even a more profound effect if you [see it at the Smithsonian](https://asia.si.edu/explore-art-culture/collections/search/edanmdm:fsg_F1911.188/).

If the script doesn't run with message "This script was not executed yet", enable "Developer Mode" in the Manage Extensions area of the browser.
